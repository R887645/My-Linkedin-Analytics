# Situation
As a Data Analyst passionate about storytelling, I decided to turn the spotlight inward, analyzing my own LinkedIn analytics over a two-year period.
The goal was simple: to understand how my personal growth, audience, and engagement have evolved, and to see whether the data aligns with my journey as an analyst and creator.

However, there was a limitation: ***my 2023 data was restricted and not fully exportable.
So, I adapted the scope and focused on comparing February to July (2023 vs 2024) using the data I could access.
