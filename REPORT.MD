# Situation
As a Data Analyst passionate about storytelling, I decided to turn the spotlight inward, analyzing my own LinkedIn analytics over a two-year period.
The goal was simple: to understand how my personal growth, audience, and engagement have evolved, and to see whether the data aligns with my journey as an analyst and creator.

However, there was a limitation: **my 2023** data was restricted and not fully exportable.
So, I adapted the scope and focused on comparing February to July (2023 vs 2024) using the data I could access.

# Task
## My main objectives were to:
1. Collect and clean LinkedIn analytics data for both years (where available).
2. Analyze key metrics such as impressions, members reached, and follower demographics.
3. Visualize and compare engagement patterns between the two years.
4. Reflect on personal growth and tell a meaningful data-driven story even with limited data.

# Action
## 1. Data Collection & Cleaning
- Extracted LinkedIn Creator Analytics data covering impressions, reach, connections, and audience demographics across multiple years.
- Cleaned and standardized 2,000+ rows of data in Excel, removing duplicates, 500 nulls, formatting timestamps, and aligning columns for year-over-year comparison.
- Utilized Power Query to reshape and transform the dataset, improving clarity and analytical accuracy.
- Imported the cleaned and structured data into Power BI, enabling dynamic visualization and trend insights.

**Despite limited data export options, leveraged available metrics to deliver meaningful insights — demonstrating that effective analysis combines creativity with data completeness**

## 2. Analysis Approach
-Compared engagement data (February–July) across two years.
-Analyzed follower locations, occupations, and growth trends.
-Calculated year-over-year changes in impressions, reach, and connections.
-Identified the most active months and recurring engagement periods.

## 3. Data Visualization
-Built interactive visuals in Power BI showing:
-Impressions growth (144 → 7,506).
-Reach increase (27 → 2,613 members).
-Follower demographics by city and profession.
-Monthly activity patterns highlight June as the most active month for both years.

# Result / Insights
## Here’s what I discovered from my own data:
## 1. Location of Followers
Lagos: 40.42%
Abuja: 19.62%
These two cities form the core of my network.

## 2. Who They Are
My followers are mostly Data Analysts, Founders, and Frontend Developers, a community that aligns perfectly with my field and interests.

## 3. Impressions Growth
Last year: 144
This year: 7,506
→ A 5,110% increase, showing massive visibility improvement.

## 4. Members Reached
Last year: 27
This year: 2,613
→ A huge expansion in audience exposure.

## 5. Most Active Months
June was consistently the most active month for both years.

## 6. Connection Growth
Growth peaked around May–June last year and June this year, confirming recurring engagement patterns.

## Reflection

**Breaking down my own data honestly made me feel like an analyst.**
**Despite the limitation of missing data, I embraced the challenge, cleaning, comparing, and visualizing what I had.**
**Seeing measurable progress in my impressions, reach, and audience profile made me realize how powerful data storytelling can be when applied to personal growth.**

This project wasn’t just about numbers; it was about turning analytics into self-awareness.

## Next Steps
**Continue tracking analytics quarterly to measure long-term trends.**
**Focus content in June, when engagement is historically highest.**
**Tailor posts for my top audience segments for Data Analysts, Founders, and Frontend Developers.**
**Experiment with A/B testing (post format, timing) to optimize engagement.**

## Tools Used
**Excel** – Data cleaning and preparation
**Power Query** – Data transformation
**Power BI** – Visualization and storytelling

## LinkedIn Analytics – Data source

## Key Takeaway

This project proved that you don’t need perfect data to tell a meaningful story.
By analyzing my own LinkedIn performance, I learned to apply analytical thinking to personal progress transforming limited metrics into clear evidence of growth.

**It’s a reminder that every dataset, even your own, has a story worth telling.**
